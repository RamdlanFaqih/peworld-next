## Usage

To run the Peworld website frontend locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Follow these steps to install Next.js and other dependencies:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   If you haven't already installed Node.js and npm, you can download and install them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new Next.js app:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new Next.js app for your Peworld website:

   ```
   npx create-next-app peworld-frontend
   ```

   This command will create a new Next.js app in a directory called `peworld`.

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   Change your current directory to the newly created Next.js app directory:

   ```
   cd peworld-frontend
   ```

4. **Install project dependencies:**
   Inside the `peworld-frontend` directory, install the project dependencies listed in the `package.json` file using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages and libraries, including Next.js, specified in the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

5. **Start the development server:**
   Once the installation is complete, you can start the Next.js development server with the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and you can view your Peworld website frontend by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Now, you have successfully installed Next.js and set up your Peworld website frontend project locally. You can start developing and customizing your website further based on your project requirements.
