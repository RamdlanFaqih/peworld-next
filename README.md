## Usage

To run the Peworld website frontend locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Follow these steps to install Next.js and other dependencies:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   If you haven't already installed Node.js and npm, you can download and install them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Certainly! If you want users to fork the Peworld website frontend repository before following the installation steps, you can include the fork step in your documentation. Here's how you can update the "Usage" section to include forking the repository:

### Usage

#### Forking the Peworld Frontend Repository

1. **Fork the repository:**
   First, fork the Peworld website frontend repository by visiting the following GitHub URL:
   [https://github.com/RamdlanFaqih/peworld-next.git](https://github.com/RamdlanFaqih/peworld-next.git)

   Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the GitHub page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the forked repository:**
   Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command (replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/peworld-next.git
   ```

   This command will clone the forked repository to your local system.

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```

4. **Install project dependencies:**
   Inside the `peworld-next` directory, install the project dependencies listed in the `package.json` file using npm:

5. **Start the development server:**
   Once the installation is complete, you can start the Next.js development server with the following command:
